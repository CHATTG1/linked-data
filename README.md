# linked-data

##OVERVIEW
Carnegie Hall Archives maintains a series of scripts to transform its historical performance history data from its source in a SQL database into the Resource Description Framework (RDF) for publication as linked open data.

These scripts have benefitted immensely from a wide community of archiving, preservation, and programming experts who share their code and troubleshooting techniques online. We are excited by the opportunity to participate in this community and have our methods improve through open collaboration and mutual exchange.
