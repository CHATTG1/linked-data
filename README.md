## OVERVIEW

**Carnegie Hall Archives is preparing the initial release of our performance history dataset. Keep an eye on this repo!**

The purpose of this repository is to share Carnegie Hall's performance history as linked open data, and resources related to its creation and maintenance. 

You can explore the Carnegie Hall (CH) performance history linked open data [here], and read more about it below.

## CONTENTS

The Carnegie Hall Archives believes in showing its work. To that goal, this repository includes:
- Link to explore the CH LOD via a SPARQL endpoint for querying, with option to download the entire dataset
- [Python scripts](/scripts/scripts-overview.md) used to transform CSV to LOD serializations
- An overview of [CH's performance history]
- Documentation about the [structure and content of the CH LOD]
